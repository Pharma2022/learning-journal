# Shah's Journal Scrimba FrontEnd Module 6 - Responsive Design

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
````
This is my learning journal 
See [Demo](https://shahs-diner.netlify.app/)

## Functionality
- This features a Menu which has items which you can add to the an order
- If you have a main dish and a beer this qualifies you for 

## Libaries that have been used
- React
- React-router
- CSS grid
- Flex-box

## Stretch goals
- I coded this using React -Router which allowed easy navigation between pages
- The use of React improved reusability
- I used a layout route for the navigation and footer
- To improve image imports - right now its slightly clunky, again it would be useful to have firebase integration to make maintenance easier.
  

## Further Stretch Goals/General Improvements
- To consider transforming this into portfolio/about me page
- To add a dark mode - currently you can force the dark mode using google chrome. Type  "chrome://flags" in the address bar if using Google Chrome or "edge://flags" if using Microsoft Edge (I imagine it will be the same for all chromium browsers).  If you scroll down to Auto Dark Mode for Web Contents (or do Ctrl+F) and select 'Enabled'
